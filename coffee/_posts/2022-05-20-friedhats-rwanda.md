### Overall
This coffee is very good, and as my first coffee from FriedHats, I am very impressed. A signature of this coffee is 
that it seems to entirely fill your mouth as you sip. There is no astringency and a very limited aftertaste. Clean. 
The flavours were very hard to place, but eventually we came to an agreement around stone fruits. Overall, this is 
an extremely drinkable, obviously sweet coffee which is very delicious. I rate it at 90. 

### Body
Consistency is thin, not creamy or buttery. Mostly clean after-feeling with a limited aftertaste. Feels very full 
in the mouth, not concentrated to a single area. Light feeling, bold flavour.

### Sweetness
A sweet coffee that comes through in berry and fruity candy sweetness. No hints of chocolate or molasses. 
Strawberries with white sugar on top. A very clean sweetness.

### Acidity
This coffee is vibrant, but, not acidic in the zing / tang sense. This coffee doesn't bite back, but, remains 
describable as a 'bright' coffee.

### Flavours
Dried apricot, slightly floral. Light stone fruit flavours such as peach or nectarine.
