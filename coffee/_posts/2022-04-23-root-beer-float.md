_2022-04-23 - Posting this as part of a backlog of coffees which I had not yet written up thoughts on._

### Overall
The roasters at Luna Coffee did an excellent job at titling this 'Rootbeer Float'. There were many times throughout drinking
this that we struggled to find the right word, always again falling back to the fact that 'Rootbeer Float' just seemed to fit.
This is a coffee that I would be happy to buy again, but if there were other offerings from the same roaster that I haven't tried,
I'd likely continue to explore those before re-buying this. I rate it at 80.

### Body
Consistency like water. Not very thick and does not feel heavy. Smooth without being creamy or buttery, much like silk. No coating
left on the mouth or tongue. A slight dryness near the back of the tongue, but not unpleasant. 

### Sweetness
Not an overly sweet coffee, however, also not particularly bitter. A very middle ground sweetness that leans more to the sweet side.
We found the sweetness came through primarily as a 'Honey Lemon' sweetness. A golden sweetness without being dark.

### Acidity
Brightness without being zingy or sharp. Not very acidic compared to coffees of similar brightness.

### Flavours
More citrus fruit flavours than dried berry or fruit. Sweet aromatics and again a flavour that we can only describe as 'Root Beer'. 
Getting hints of cola. We found the flavours in this coffee very hard to place
