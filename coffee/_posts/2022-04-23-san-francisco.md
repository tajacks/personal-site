_2022-04-23 - Posting this as part of a backlog of coffees which I had not yet written up thoughts on._

### Overall
This was a charming coffee (including the packaging) that ticks all the boxes of third wave, speciality coffee. It was 
easy to drink, enjoyable, and I'd be happy to drink it if it was served. I don't anticipate buying again should it be
available, however, it is well worth checking out the roaster. I rate it a 75.

### Body
Not a heavy body. Not buttery or creamy but still considered very smooth. More like velvet smoothness than a buttery 
creaminess. Doesn't stick to the tongue or sides of the mouth in excess, only slightly.  

### Sweetness
Back of the tongue medium to sweet sweetness is present. Not a heavy or obvious sweetness. The word that we came up with
to best describe it is 'Round'.

### Acidity
There is a brightness to this coffee that is achieved without it being considered sharp. Again experienced mostly at the 
back and sides of the tongue. Not overtly zingy or sharp, the acidity came across as muted citrus tones.

### Flavours
This is a fruity coffee. No doubt about that. Purple stone fruits. A bit of grape flavour as well. Black tea as it cooled. 
Although the acidity is akin to citrus, the flavours themselves are not strongly citrus.
