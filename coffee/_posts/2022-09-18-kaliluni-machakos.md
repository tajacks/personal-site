### Overall
My first coffee from the Norwegian roaster Solberg & Hansen impressed me thoroughly. I'm glad that I had a chance to 
try this before the end of summer as the coffee seems to express many of the same qualities of the season. Thin and 
super-sippable, deep berry flavours, and little to no aftertaste made this coffee almost refreshing despite it being 
a hot drink on a hot day. 

### Body
Thin body, clean cup. Almost crisp. Somehow refreshing despite being drank on a 30&#176; day. Not a hint of 
creaminess, thickness, or butter. Minor bitter aftertaste felt in the mouth, which faded quickly. 

### Sweetness
While there is sweetness present, it is not easy to pinpoint. It is easier to identify which type of sweetness is 
not present, which is dark or cocoa. Sweeter as it cools. Gentle. 

### Acidity
This coffee started brighter than it finished. Original acidity hit in the middle of the tongue and was very present.
As it cooled, acidity gave way to a more mellow experience which allowed flavours to be more easily identified. 

### Flavours
Gentle fruitiness, hard to place specifically. Thoughts of dark fruit and berries. Black cherry, dark berry pie.
