### Overall
Momo's Kenya Nyeri Hill AA is good coffee that verges on great. The first sips seem lackluster, primarily 
because excessive heat was masking the brightness this coffee has. It is much better once cooled, at least 7 minutes.
Overall I enjoyed this coffees limited astringency, especially considering how much acid is present. The sweetness is 
subtle and presents itself as a golden sweetness, akin to honey or syrup. I would consider this coffee a buy if 
you enjoy bright, high quality, African coffees.

### Body
I consider the body of this coffee as medium to light. There is a light coating on the sides of the mouth and back of 
the tongue. This is not a negative, as there is limited dryness / drying feeling present. This coffee is smooth, but 
absolutely not creamy or thick. Think velvet, instead of cream.

### Sweetness
This is not a particularly sweet coffee. Sweetness presents itself in the back-middle of the tongue, but you have to 
look to find it.

### Acidity
Although not sharp or zingy, this is a very bright coffee. The juiciness of this coffee hits primary in the middle of 
the tongue and is felt strongly as it continues to cool. 

### Flavours
This is a coffee in which the dried stone fruit flavours are brought together by the syrupy sweetness. Althought subtle,
I also tasted strawberry / red fruit.
