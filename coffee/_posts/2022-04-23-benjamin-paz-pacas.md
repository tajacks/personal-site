_2022-04-23 - Posting this as part of a backlog of coffees which I had not yet written up thoughts on._

### Overall
I was not a fan of this coffee. I did do my due diligence and tried brewing this coffee many ways. Grind settings,
brewing devices, you name it. Perhaps I still just got unlucky with my brew combination, but, this coffee wasn't it for me. 
I found the overall experience much better as it cooled. Overall I rate it a 62.

### Body
Thick, buttery, and leaves an impression on the tongue and mouth. An astringent feeling coupled with an aftertaste. It 
leaves a coating in the mouth which makes you want a cup of water.

### Sweetness
Not a sweet coffee by any means. If there is any sweetness present, it is quite hard to discern. 

### Acidity
Astringent / puckering acidity. Drying as opposed to bright and tangy. Tart.

### Flavours
Dark chocolate bitters. More black tea flavours as it cooled. A hard flavour to nail down. Nutty.
